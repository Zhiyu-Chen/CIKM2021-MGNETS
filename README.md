# CIKM2021-MGNETS

This repository has the results for "MGNETS: Multi-Graph Neural Networks for Table Search (CIKM 2021)".
The name of each folder corresponds to method in Table 1. Each folder contains the results/qrel file of 5 folds used in [SIGIR 2020](https://github.com/Zhiyu-Chen/SIGIR2020-BERT-Table-Search). 

Note: BERT-base was used in this paper, while  [SIGIR 2020](https://github.com/Zhiyu-Chen/SIGIR2020-BERT-Table-Search) used BERT-large.

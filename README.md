# CIKM2021-MGNETS

This repository has the results for [MGNETS(CIKM 2021)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3459637.3482140).
The name of each folder corresponds to method in Table 1. Each folder contains the results/qrel file of 5 folds used in [SIGIR 2020](https://github.com/Zhiyu-Chen/SIGIR2020-BERT-Table-Search). 

Note: BERT-base was used in this paper, while  [SIGIR 2020](https://github.com/Zhiyu-Chen/SIGIR2020-BERT-Table-Search) used BERT-large. ConvKNRM here is a rerun version thus the scores are slightly different from the original paper. The others are the original runs.
